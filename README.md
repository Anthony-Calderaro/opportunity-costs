<h1>About:</h1>
This app was made to showcase the different aspects of financial decision-making: Return, Cost, and Risk. By using contrived hypothetical situations, the user can walk through their own intuitive understanding of these concepts, and see how other users responded to the same questions, updated in real time.

<br />
This is a full-stack application built using ReactJS and a Firebase backend to handle the real-time updates of the vote counts. Chartjs (https://www.chartjs.org/) and React ChartJS(https://github.com/reactjs/react-chartjs) are also used for visualizing the data in the pie charts.
